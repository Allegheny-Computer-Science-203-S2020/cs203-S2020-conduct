# cs203-S2020-conduct

This repository contains the conduct guide for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2020](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2020/). The instructor
and students will use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## Improving the Conduct Guide

Please use the [GitHub flow
model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively improve
the conduct guide. First, you should finalize the list of group-related
professional skills on the assessment sheet. Then, you should describe the
student and instructor behaviors that the team deems to be acceptable and
unacceptable. Students are invited to review the [Codes of Values from MIT's
Course on Product Engineering
Processes](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/codeOfEthics/codeOfEthics.html).

Make sure that you explain how the team will handle infractions of the conduct
guide. Finally, once you are finished with this conduct guide, please update the
README as necessary. You must also ensure that the conduct guide aligns with the
assessment sheet.

## Problems with the Conduct Guide

If you have any problems with this conduct guide, then please create an issue
in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site.
