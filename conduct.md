### Decisions

A 3/4th majority of people in a group should agree upon a given decision before it's
implemented. They should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the choice is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. Before
deciding you should reach out to other groups whom the choice will influence.
Teams will determine how long a decision will take to implement. Group decisions won't be
foreboding, but should unite the group to solve a problem together!

* **Acceptable Conduct (A):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process.
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive.
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members.
    * Record what choice was made and when it was implemented.
    * Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure.
    * Use online polls to reach a group consensus about a decision.
    * Distribute tasks to all group members.
    * A new decision should be made when a previous decision cannot be implemented.
    * When a choice is disputed use a slack poll using the extension Polly.

* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
