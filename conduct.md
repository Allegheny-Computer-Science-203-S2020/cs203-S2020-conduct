### Decisions

A majority of people in a group should agree upon a given decision before
it can be implemented. Decisions should be made on the basis of supporting evidence
that show that the choice would be reasonable and productive. When a choice
is being disputed in a group a poll can be used to make the decision with
a 3/4th majority. When unsure about making a decision you should defer to a TA
or the professor. Before enacting a decision you should reach out to other
groups whom the choice you made will affect. Decisions should not be
forboding, but should unite the group to acomplish a problem together!
