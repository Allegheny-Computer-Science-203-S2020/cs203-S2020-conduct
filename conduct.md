Infraction(s) shall be defined as a penalty for violating the above Conduct Guide outline by any individual who has agreed to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below. The infractions for any individual shall be recorded and managed by the instructor.

A violation of the Conduct Guide can be defined as any behavior that is considered Unacceptable (U) for any of the above outlined (sub)sections.

  * *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*

    * Level I: A Level I infraction is defined as a formally documented violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project. All Level I infractions are minor violations and will be reset weekly.
    * Level II: A Level II infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated four Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction, the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a checkmark grade for the week. All Level II infractions are intermediate violations and will be reset weekly.
    * Level III: A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated six Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction, the individual will be docked 15% of their grade for the current project. All Level III infractions are major  violations and will be reset after the completion of the current project.

If an individual commits multiple violations of the Conduct Guide, a team or project leader may contact the instructor directly, provided there is proper citation to the Conduct Guide for the violations. While a team or project leader may suggest any number of infractions, an individual should not incur more than four infractions for a single instance of violations. The number of Level I infractions imposed upon the individual shall ultimately be determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received from the instructor for being given the infraction(s) will be final.
