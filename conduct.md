### Decisions

The majority of people in a team should agree upon a given decision before it's
implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement. Team decisions shouldn't be foreboding,
but should unite the team to solve a problem together!

* **Acceptable Conduct (A):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members
    * Record what choice was made and when it was implemented
    * Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure
    * Distribute tasks to all team members
    * A new decision should be made when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    * When a choice is disputed, use a slack poll using the extension Polly

* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Let an individual team member or leader make major decisions

    * Directly contradict the decision
    * Refuse to work on the decided option
    * Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them

* Postmortems
* Conflicts
* Infractions
