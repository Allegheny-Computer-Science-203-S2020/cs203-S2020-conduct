# Conduct for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

* Overall Conduct

  This section defines how each team-member should and should-not act while
  working on a project which this Code of Conduct is a part of. Everyone is
  required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
  sections of this Code of Conduct. Respect, not only for everyone regardless of
  race and gender, but also for everyone as learners and fellow team members is
  mandatory. This is a project in which team-members have different skillsets
  and different levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning
  a team member for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and
  using other people's work is a core part of learning  how to code effectively,
  yet when used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work
  without their permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively
  impact a project's success. Therefore, member's of this project should adhere
  to Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.
