### Decisions

A majority of people in a group should agree upon a given decision before it's
implemented. Decisions should be made on the basis of supporting evidence that show
that the choice would be reasonable and productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a TA or the professor. Before enacting a decision you
should reach out to other groups whom the choice you made will affect. Teams will
determine how long a decision will take to implement. Group decisions won't be
foreboding, but should unite the group to solve a problem together!

* **Acceptable Conduct (A):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Take into account everyones input in the decision making process.
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive.
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members.
    * Record what decision was made and when it was implemented.
    * Defer to the Professor or teaching assistants when concerned about a decision.
    * Use online polls to reach a group consensus about a decision.
    * Team members should decide the priority of the issue using a "URGENT" tag.
    * Delegate tasks to all group members.
    * A new approach should be pursued when you cannot implement a past decision.
    * When a choice is disputed a poll can make the decision with a 3/4th majority.

* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Let the team leader individually make major decisions.
    * Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial.
    * Directly contradict the decision.
