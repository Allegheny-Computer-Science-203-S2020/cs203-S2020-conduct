# Conduct for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

  This section defines how each team member should and should not act while
  working on a project which this Code of Conduct is a part of. Everyone is
  required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
  sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
  members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This
  is a project in which team members have different skillsets and different
  levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a team member
  for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
  people's work is a core part of learning  how to code effectively, yet when
  used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
  permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact a
  project's success. Therefore, members of this project should adhere to
  Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    * Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    * Read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct
    * Follow the honor code on all submitted work

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Disrespect peers because of their race or gender
    * Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions
    * Violate any part of this Code of Conduct
    * Violate the Allegheny honor code in regards to all submitted work

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication

This section defines what communication is acceptable and unacceptable.
It is vital that team members not only communicate clearly, but
communicate using the right platforms and methods, such as GitHub
issues tracker or slack. For example, something may be clearly
communicated in Slack, but may still receive an 'unacceptable' because
Slack was the inappropriate platform to use.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Team Members shall
    * Effectively communicate electronically and in person
    * Use appropriate softwares for electronic communication
    * Always participate in the discussion and review portion of the
      GitHub flow model.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Team Members shall not
    * Rarely communicate in person or electronically
    * Frequently use inappropriate forums such as text messaging or
      using slack instead  of GitHub issues tracker.
    * Rarely engage in the discussion and review portion of the GitHub
      flow model.

## Participation

Every team member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts
in a respectful manner. Our project at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in project discussion means engaging
in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Respond quickly in Slack to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues
    * Value and consider everyone’s opinion
    * Be willing to meetup and work outside of class
    * Approach issues and team members with professionalism
    * Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks
    * Be open minded
    * Raise a disagreeing opinion in a respectful manner

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Demonstrate disrespect for team members
    * Have an inappropriate professional boundary with team members
    * Show poor participation and attitude to their lab delegated tasks
    * Demonstrate patterns of poor communication or little effort for
    collaboration in lab and Slack
    * Disrupt working groups’ effectiveness by lack of collaboration
    * Lack insights into his or her level of competence
    * Attempt to dominate a lab discussions
    * Miss lab sessions without the consent of the professor

## Decisions

The majority of people in a team should agree upon a given decision before the
software is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members
    * Record what choice was made and when it was implemented
    * Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure
    * Distribute tasks to all team members
    * A new decision should be made when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    * When a choice is disputed, use Github issue tracker and let team members
      share their opinion

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Let an individual team member or leader make major decisions
    * Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial
    * Directly contradict the decision
    * Refuse to work on the decided option
    * Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them

## Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues

## Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group of
software engineers. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a
professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful
    conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers and the course instructor are responsible for resolving any
    issues by proposing solutions to reach a compromise between
    class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a
    conflict
    * Project managers and the course instructor have a final say in how conflicts
    should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the classroom when
    encountering a conflict

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code
    of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict
    that has been brought to their attention

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the code of conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions.
Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus
a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all student in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Software Engineering Class for the Spring semester
of 2020.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*
  * Level I: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I
  infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be
  keeping track of infractions.
   A level I infraction is simply a warning to avoid
  misconduct.
  * Level II:Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project
  managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.
  Once such infraction is issued, the person involved must meet with
  the instructor and technical leaders to develop a plan to prevent
  future infractions. Refusal to meet would cause a level III infraction.
  * Level III A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has
  accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
  the individual will be docked 15% of their grade for the current project.
  A level III infraction will also occur when the person involves fails  to
  meet with the instructor following a level II  infraction.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe and friendly environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
