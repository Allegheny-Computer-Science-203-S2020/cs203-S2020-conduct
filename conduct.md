# Conduct for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

* Overall Conduct
* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication

### Participation

Every team member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts
in a respectful manner. Our project at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in project discussion means engaging
in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Respond quickly in Slack to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues
    * Value and consider everyone’s opinion
    * Be willing to meetup and work outside of class
    * Approach issues and team members with professionalism
    * Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks
    * Be open minded
    * Raise a disagreeing opinion in a respectful manner

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Demonstrate disrespect for team members
    * Have an inappropriate professional boundary with team members
    * Show poor participation and attitude to their lab delegated tasks
    * Demonstrate patterns of poor communication or little effort for
    collaboration in lab and Slack
    * Disrupt working groups’ effectiveness by lack of collaboration
    * Lack insights into his or her level of competence
    * Attempt to dominate a lab discussions
    * Miss lab sessions without the consent of the professor

* Decisions

## Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group of
software engineers. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a
professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful
    conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers and the course instructor are responsible for resolving any
    issues by proposing solutions to reach a compromise between
    class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a
    conflict
    * Project managers and the course instructor have a final say in how conflicts
    should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the classroom when
    encountering a conflict

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code
    of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict
    that has been brought to their attention

## Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues

* Infractions
