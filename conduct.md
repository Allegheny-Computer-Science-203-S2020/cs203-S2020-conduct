Deadlines should be made by the team leaders of the project and there should be
multiple deadlines before the final deadline in order to make sure that everything

Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work will be completed leaving time

Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may not
align with yours.
Make sure that everyone agrees on the deadlines set by their team. 
All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas the
electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository before
the assigned deadline.
Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by the students,
and within the one week period before the next laboratory session begins.

Unacceptable Behavior (U):
Members shall not:

Fail to discuss issues with team members before it is too late to fix the issues.
Fail to complete work before the deadlines.
Fail to communicate reasons for work being late.
If work is submitted after the specified deadline, the assignment will not be accepted
