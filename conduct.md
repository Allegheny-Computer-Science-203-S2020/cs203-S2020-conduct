# Conduct for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

* Overall Conduct
* Attendance
* Deadlines

Deadlines should be made by the team leaders of the project and there should be
multiple deadlines before the final deadline in order to make sure that everything
is preceding as they should

Acceptable Behavior (A):
Members shall:

Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.
Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work will be completed leaving time
for the rest of the lab.
Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may not
align with yours.
Make sure that everyone agrees on the deadlines set by their team.
All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas the
electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository before
the assigned deadline.
Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by the students,
and within the one week period before the next laboratory session begins.

Unacceptable Behavior (U):
Members shall not:

Fail to discuss issues with team members before it is too late to fix the issues.
Fail to complete work before the deadlines.
Fail to communicate reasons for work being late.
If work is submitted after the specified deadline, the assignment will not be accepted
and no credit will be given (unless specified otherwise).

* Communication
* Participation
* Decisions

## Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group of
software engineers. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a
professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful
    conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers and the course instructor are responsible for resolving any
    issues by proposing solutions to reach a compromise between
    class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a
    conflict
    * Project managers and the course instructor have a final say in how conflicts
    should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the classroom when
    encountering a conflict

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code
    of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict
    that has been brought to their attention

## Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues

* Infractions
