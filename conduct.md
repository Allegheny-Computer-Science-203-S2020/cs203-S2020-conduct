## Infractions

An infraction occurs when a class member violates agreed upon rules present in
the code of conduct. Any action that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class members should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of previous infractions.
Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus
a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all student in Allegheny College and is
enforced by the college's honor committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Software Engineering Class for the Spring semester of
2020.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*
  * __Level I__: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I
  infraction. The instructor and project managers will record and keep track of
  these violations and all others that follow. A level I infraction is simply
  a warning to avoid future misconduct.
  * __Level II__:Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project
  managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.
  Once such infraction is issued, the person involved must meet with
  the instructor and technical leaders to develop a plan to prevent
  future infractions. Refusal to meet would cause a level III infraction.
  * __Level III__: A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has
  accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
  the instructor will have the ability to decrease the individual's grade
  for the project by 15%. A level III infraction will also occur
  when the person involves fails  to meet with the instructor following a
  level II  infraction.

All class members are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe and friendly environment. Class member(s) may appeal any infraction
to the instructor of the class. Any decision made by the instructor for the given
infraction(s) will be final. Every infraction that is reviewed will be recorded
and lead to different levels of severity.
