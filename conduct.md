### Participation

Every team member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts
in a respectful manner. Our project at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in project discussion means engaging
in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

## Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues

* Conflicts
* Infractions
