# Conduct for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

  This section defines how each team member should and should not act while
  working on a project which this Code of Conduct is a part of. Everyone is
  required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
  sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
  members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This
  is a project in which team members have different skillsets and different
  levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a team member
  for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
  people's work is a core part of learning  how to code effectively, yet when
  used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
  permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact a
  project's success. Therefore, members of this project should adhere to
  Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):

  * Members shall
    * Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    * Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    * Read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct
    * Follow the honor code on all submitted work

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  * Members shall not
    * Disrespect peers because of their race or gender
    * Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions
    * Violate any part of this Code of Conduct
    * Violate the Allegheny honor code in regards to all submitted work

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
* Participation
* Decisions

## Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group of
software engineers. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a
professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful
    conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers and the course instructor are responsible for resolving any
    issues by proposing solutions to reach a compromise between
    class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a
    conflict
    * Project managers and the course instructor have a final say in how conflicts
    should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the classroom when
    encountering a conflict

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code
    of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict
    that has been brought to their attention

## Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the code of conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions.
Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus
a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all student in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Software Engineering Class for the Spring semester
of 2020.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*
  * Level I: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I
  infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be
  keeping track of infractions.
   A level I infraction is simply a warning to avoid
  misconduct.
  * Level II:Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project
  managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.
  Once such infraction is issued, the person involved must meet with
  the instructor and technical leaders to develop a plan to prevent
  future infractions. Refusal to meet would cause a level III infraction.
  * Level III A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has
  accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
  the individual will be docked 15% of their grade for the current project.
  A level III infraction will also occur when the person involves fails  to
  meet with the instructor following a level II  infraction.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe and friendly environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
