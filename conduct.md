## Infractions

An infraction occurs when a class member violates agreed upon rules present in
the code of conduct. Any action that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class members should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of previous infractions.
Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus
a more severe penalty.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*
  * __Level I__: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I
  infraction. These will be recorded by the instructor and the technical leaders
  who will keep track of them. A level I infraction is simply a warning to avoid
  misconduct.
  * __Level II__:Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, a formal
  level II infraction will be issued. Once such infraction is issued, the person
  involved must meet with the instructor and technical leaders to develop a plan
  to prevent future infractions. Refusal to meet would cause a level III
  infraction.
  * __Level III__: A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has
  accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
  the individual will be docked 15% of their grade for the current project.
  A level III infraction will also occur when the person involves fails  to
  meet with the instructor following a level II  infraction.

All class members are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe and friendly environment. A class member(s) may appeal any infraction
to the instructor of the class. Any decision made by the instructor for the given
infraction(s) will be final. Every infraction that is reviewed will be recorded
and lead to different levels of severity.
